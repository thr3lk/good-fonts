This is a placeholder, forshadowing things to come.

I've collected references to so many fonts over the years, 
for writing, 
for designing, 
for coding, 
for data visuializations,
for interfaces. 

So many good fonts, many of them open source or licensed under libre terms, 
some of them pushing at the edges of what a font (or even typeface) can be.

Currently, [good-fonts.tsv](./good-fonts.tsv) is the only file that matters here. 
I intend to build something a bit more user friendly (and maybe a bit less manual) 
eventually, but it will all be built atop of the tsv file.

In the meantime I'm compiling [specimens on Are.na](https://www.are.na/threlk/good-fonts-vvzvgkf4dys).
